Two different ways for calculating the local time-step are available:

localTimeStep-minDeltaX.C uses the approach to calculate the maximum local time-step based on the minimum
distance of the cell center to a face center in each cell.

localTimeStep-DeltaCoeffs.C makes use of OpenFOAM's deltaCoefficients. Here the time-step is based on the
distance of the owner and neighbour cell centers.
This approach might me more efficient than the minDeltaX-approach, because the deltaCoefficients are already
available and don't have to be re-evaluated in each iteration for moving meshes.

The first approach has been sucessfully tested for a wide band of applications.
For the latter some additional testings have to be performed. The viscous time-step has been dropped here.

To choose one of schemes, the contents of the .C and .H files have to be copied into the localTimeStep.C and
localTimeStep.H. Then the timeStepping library has to be recompiled.
